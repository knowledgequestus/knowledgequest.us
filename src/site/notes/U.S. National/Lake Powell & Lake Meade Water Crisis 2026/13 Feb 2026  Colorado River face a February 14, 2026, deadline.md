The seven states that rely on the Colorado River face a February 14, 2026, deadline to reach a new water-sharing agreement. However, it appears they may not meet that deadline, as they continue to struggle with deep disagreements amid worsening drought conditions.

If the states fail to reach an agreement by February 14, the federal government is expected to step in and impose its own plan to protect the river’s reservoirs and dams. Such federal intervention could result in significant water delivery cuts, particularly for Arizona, Nevada, and California. It could also trigger a wave of legal challenges, potentially sending the issue into the courts. Many state leaders want to avoid litigation, which could drag on for years with uncertain outcomes. There is additional concern that if water levels drop much further, hydropower turbines at Glen Canyon Dam could shut down, and the flow of water from Lake Powell downstream could be severely limited.

Since the federal government has already completed its preliminary draft survey, it is positioned to act quickly if the states miss the deadline. Federal officials could move ahead with their own management plan within months—finalizing proposed rules, completing remaining reviews, and beginning to implement water delivery cuts. This accelerated timeline places extra pressure on the states to resolve their differences and avoid a courtroom battle.

With much of the groundwork already completed, the federal government is prepared to move decisively if the states fail to reach an accord—finalizing decisions, enforcing mandatory cuts, and executing its management plan far faster than if preparations were still underway.
