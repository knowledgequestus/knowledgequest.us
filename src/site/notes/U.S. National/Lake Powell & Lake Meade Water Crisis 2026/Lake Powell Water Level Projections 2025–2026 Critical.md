## Current Situation
As of February 18, 2026, Lake Powell's elevation stands at approximately **3,532.45 feet** above sea level, which is **167.55 feet below full pool** (3,700 ft) and holds about 5.98 million acre-feet — roughly **25% of capacity**. The reservoir is down approximately **1.92 feet over the last 14 measurements** alone, as shown in the user's attached data, with daily declines averaging -0.14 feet.

The lake is currently about **42 feet above minimum power pool** (3,490 ft) — the elevation at which Glen Canyon Dam can no longer generate hydroelectric power.

## Critical Elevation Thresholds
Lake Powell has three critical water level thresholds that trigger increasingly severe consequences:

| Threshold              | Elevation | Significance                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buffer Target**      | 3,525 ft  | Triggers emergency actions to prevent further decline[4]                                                         |
| **Minimum Power Pool** | 3,490 ft  | Glen Canyon Dam can no longer generate hydroelectric power; turbines must shut down to prevent cavitation damage |
| **Dead Pool**          | 3,370 ft  | Water can no longer pass through the dam to downstream users; complete operational failure                       |

## 2025 Baseline: What Happened Last Year
Lake Powell experienced a steady decline through most of 2025, with only a modest spring bump from snowmelt:

| Month (2025) | End-of-Month Elevation (ft) |
|---|---|
| January | 3,566.75 |
| February | 3,562.75 |
| March | 3,559.30 |
| April | 3,557.90 |
| May | 3,558.98 |
| June | 3,561.30 (seasonal peak) |
| July | 3,555.36 |
| August | 3,548.18 |
| September | 3,544.69 |
| October | 3,545.46 |
| November | 3,543.26 |
| December | 3,540.31 |

The lake began 2025 at **3,566.75 feet** and ended the year at roughly **3,540 feet**, a net decline of about **27 feet** over the year. The spring runoff period (May–June) provided only a brief and modest rise of about 4 feet before the steep summer drawdown resumed. By November 2025, Lake Powell was at **44% of typical storage** — the lowest observed for that date in the last 30 years.

## 2026 Projections: Bureau of Reclamation February 24-Month Study
The Bureau of Reclamation's **February 2026 24-Month Study** provides three scenarios for Lake Powell's trajectory this year:
### Most Probable Scenario (52% of average inflow)
| Month (2026) | Projected Elevation (ft) | Distance Above Min Power Pool (ft) |
|---|---|---|
| January | 3,535.02 | 45.02 |
| February | 3,530.95 | 40.95 |
| March | 3,528.02 | 38.02 |
| April | 3,525.43 | 35.43 |
| May | 3,525.66 | 35.66 |
| June | 3,523.75 | 33.75 |
| July | 3,514.80 | 24.80 |
| August | 3,504.20 | 14.20 |
| September | 3,497.52 | 7.52 |
| October | 3,495.31 | 5.31 |
| November | 3,492.97 | 2.97 |
| **December** | **3,488.42** | **-1.58 (BELOW)** |

Under the most probable scenario, Lake Powell is projected to **drop below minimum power pool (3,490 ft) by December 2026**. The end of water year 2026 (September 30) projection is **3,497.52 feet** with approximately 4.10 million acre-feet in storage (18% of capacity).
### Minimum (Worst Case) Scenario (37% of average inflow)
Under the worst case scenario, Lake Powell could reach minimum power pool **as early as August 2026**, falling to approximately **3,479 feet by September** — which would mark the **lowest elevation since the reservoir was originally filled**. By the end of water year 2026, the minimum scenario projects the elevation at **3,479.37 feet**.
### Maximum Scenario
The maximum inflow forecast would place Lake Powell at **3,566.57 feet** by end of water year 2026 — roughly where the lake started 2025. This scenario would require substantially above-average precipitation.

### Timeline Projections

**Buffer Target (3,525 ft):**
- **Most Probable:** Breached by **April 2026** (projected 3,525.43 ft, barely above)[9]
- **Worst Case:** Breached by **March–April 2026**

**Minimum Power Pool (3,490 ft):**
- **Most Probable:** Reached in **December 2026** (projected 3,488.42 ft)[1][11]
- **Worst Case:** Could be reached as early as **August 2026**
- At minimum power pool, Glen Canyon Dam **ceases all hydroelectric generation**, removing a cheap renewable power source serving communities across Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Nebraska

**Dead Pool (3,370 ft):**
- Not projected to be reached in 2026 under any current scenario
- Under the minimum scenario, the lake could approach **3,465 feet by December 2026**, still roughly 95 feet above dead pool
- However, if conditions worsen into 2027, dead pool becomes a growing concern; the most probable forecast shows Lake Powell at **3,476 feet by March 2027**

## Key Factors Driving the Decline
### Inflow Crisis
The February 2026 forecast projects only **5.02 million acre-feet** of unregulated inflow for water year 2026, just **52% of the 30-year average**. The critical April–July runoff period — when snowmelt normally fills the reservoir — is forecast at only **38% of average** (2.40 maf). January 2026 inflow was 79% of average, and February is forecast at just 71%. Snowpack across the upper Colorado River basin is approximately **56% of average**.
### Outflows Exceeding Inflows
The lake is releasing more water than it receives. The user's attached data shows average daily outflows of approximately **9,396 cfs** against average inflows of only **4,945 cfs** — outflows nearly **double** inflows. The water year 2026 release from Glen Canyon Dam is projected at **7.48 million acre-feet**, significantly exceeding the 5.02 maf inflow forecast.
### Emergency Measures Already Underway
Since December 1, 2025, the Bureau of Reclamation has been **holding back 598,000 acre-feet** in Lake Powell by adjusting monthly release patterns — water that must eventually be released later in the water year. Federal officials are working to maintain Powell's level above 3,525 feet, or at minimum 3,500 feet. Under a 2024 short-term agreement, releases could potentially be cut to as low as **6 million acre-feet** to avoid falling below 3,500 feet.
### Upstream Reservoir Releases
If conditions continue to deteriorate, federal managers may call for **emergency water releases from upstream reservoirs** like Flaming Gorge (Wyoming) and Blue Mesa (Colorado) to prop up Lake Powell's levels.

## 2025 vs. 2026 Comparison
| Metric | 2025 | 2026 (Projected) |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Starting Elevation (Jan 1) | 3,566.75 ft | 3,535.02 ft |
| Net Annual Decline | ~27 ft | ~47 ft (most probable) |
| Lowest Point | 3,540.31 ft (Dec) | 3,488.42 ft (Dec, projected) |
| Spring Peak Rise | ~4 ft (May–Jun) | ~2 ft (May, projected) |
| % of Average Inflow | ~70-80% | 52% (projected) |
| Storage at Year End | ~27% capacity | ~18% capacity (projected) |

The 2026 decline is projected to be **nearly twice as steep** as 2025 due to significantly lower inflows and a starting position already 32 feet lower than last year.

## Downstream Implications
### Hydropower Loss
Lake Powell's Glen Canyon Powerplant produces about **5 billion kilowatt-hours** annually, serving communities across seven states. Losing this generation capacity would force utilities to find replacement power, likely from more expensive and carbon-intensive sources.
### Water Supply for 40 Million People
The Colorado River system supplies water to approximately **40 million people** and irrigates over **5 million acres** of agricultural land. Operating rules governing the river's use **expire at the end of 2026**, and negotiations among the basin states remain deadlocked.
### Operational Uncertainty
If Lake Powell drops below minimum power pool, water can only be released through bypass tubes rather than through the power plant penstocks, significantly reducing the dam's ability to manage downstream water deliveries. One analysis describes minimum power pool as essentially **"de facto dead pool"** in terms of operational flexibility.

***
## Outlook Summary
The situation is more severe than any point during the 2021–2023 drought crisis, when Lake Powell came within 30 feet of minimum power pool in March 2023. Under current conditions:

- **By spring 2026:** The buffer target of 3,525 feet will be breached, triggering emergency protocols
- **By summer 2026 (Jul–Aug):** The lake drops rapidly as outflows spike; under the worst case, minimum power pool could be reached as early as August
- **By fall–winter 2026 (Oct–Dec):** Under the most probable scenario, the reservoir approaches and then falls below 3,490 feet for the first time in history
- **By early 2027:** Under the most probable forecast, the lake continues declining to approximately 3,476 feet by March 2027 — a new all-time low since the reservoir was filled.

The only factors that could substantially alter this trajectory are **significantly above-average late-winter/spring precipitation**, **further reductions in mandated releases**, or **emergency upstream reservoir releases**.
