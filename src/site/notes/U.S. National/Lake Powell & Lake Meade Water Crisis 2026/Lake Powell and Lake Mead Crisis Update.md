# Current Update on Lake Powell and Lake Mead: A Critical Water Source in Crisis

Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the two largest reservoirs on the Colorado River, are facing a serious water crisis in early 2026. These giant reservoirs provide water to nearly 40 million people across the American Southwest. They also supply water to irrigate about 5.5 million acres of farmland and support 22 Native American tribes.

## Current Water Levels

As of early February 2026, both reservoirs are far below their normal capacity:

- **Lake Mead** is at 34% of its total capacity, with a water level around 1,065 feet above sea level.
    
- **Lake Powell** holds just 25-26% of its capacity, with water levels at approximately 3,534 feet above sea level—about 165 feet below full pool.

These numbers mark a stark decline from historical levels. In the early 2000s, both reservoirs were at about 95% capacity. In 2022, they dropped to just 25% of capacity, their lowest levels on record. While there was some temporary recovery in 2023 and 2024, the current drought has reversed those gains.

## Record-Low Snowpack Makes Things Worse

A warm and dry winter is making the situation even more troubling. Colorado's statewide snowpack is at its lowest level on record. The Rocky Mountain snowpack sits at just 57% of average—one of the smallest in decades.

Water supply forecasts reflect this grim reality:

- Inflows into Lake Powell are expected to reach only 60% of normal for the water year.
    
- April through July inflows, when most snowmelt reaches the reservoirs, are projected at just 43% of normal.
    
Without strong spring snowmelt, water levels in both lakes are likely to continue falling through the summer and beyond.

## Future Projections Raise Alarms

Federal forecasts paint a worrying picture for the next two years:

- Lake Mead could fall to 1,036.5 feet by November 2027—lower than any recorded level in 2022, when the reservoir hit its all-time low.
    
- Lake Powell could drop below 3,490 feet by the end of 2026, a level that would stop hydropower generation at Glen Canyon Dam entirely.
    

At these levels, the dams would struggle to produce electricity. Glen Canyon Dam normally generates power for about 5 million people across Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Nebraska.

## The Dead Pool Threat

If water levels continue to drop, both reservoirs face the danger of reaching "dead pool." Dead pool is the point where water is too low to flow through the dam.

- Lake Mead would reach dead pool at 895 feet above sea level.
    
- Lake Powell would reach dead pool at 3,370 feet.
    
At dead pool, hydropower generation would completely stop, and water deliveries downstream would be cut off. This would be catastrophic for cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Diego, as well as for farms that grow a large share of the nation's winter vegetables.

## Seven States Struggle to Agree

The Colorado River is shared by seven states: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming in the Upper Basin, and Arizona, California, and Nevada in the Lower Basin. These states have been negotiating new rules to manage the river, but talks have hit a wall.

Key points of disagreement include:

- **How much water to release from Lake Powell to Lake Mead each year.** The Lower Basin expects about 7.5 million acre-feet per year, but Upper Basin negotiators have proposed amounts as low as 7 million acre-feet.
    
- **Who should cut water use first.** The Lower Basin has offered to reduce its use by 1.5 million acre-feet per year but wants the Upper Basin to also commit to firm reductions.
    
- **Mandatory versus voluntary cuts.** Upper Basin states say they cannot legally force water users with older water rights to give up their supply.
    
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has set a February 14 deadline for the states to reach a deal. If they fail, the federal government may impose cuts on its own—or the dispute could end up in court.

## Who Would Be Affected

The stakes are high for millions of people:

- Arizona relies on the Colorado River for more than a third of its water supply. Phoenix and Tucson face potential shortages.
    
- Las Vegas gets about 90% of its drinking water from Lake Mead.
    
- California's Imperial Valley, the largest single water rights holder on the river, irrigates vast farmlands.
    
- Farms across the region produce a majority of the nation's winter vegetables.
    
Federal proposals show that without a deal, Arizona could face cuts between 33% and 69% of its Colorado River water. Nevada could see reductions of 24% to 67%. California could face cuts of 29% to 33%.

## What Happens Next

Negotiators are running out of time. If no agreement is reached, federal rules could take effect unilaterally, or states could sue each other in what would be a long and uncertain legal battle.

Meanwhile, water managers are watching every new forecast closely. Decisions about emergency releases from upstream reservoirs, cuts to downstream deliveries, and plans for rationing may all come into play in the months ahead.

The situation at Lake Powell and Lake Mead is a reminder of how fragile the water supply is for the American Southwest. Without significant rain and snow—or major changes in how water is used—the crisis will only deepen.
